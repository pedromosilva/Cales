                            To come from the Airpot you can catch the metro staying at the airport 
                            (it is the final station, so there is only one, it is the Purple Line E), 
                            you will need to change line, I recommend to do it in the station of Carolina Michaelis. 
                            Here you just need to hop out and hop on in the same platform, just switch to the line going direction 
                            "Estadio do Dragao" Line A, color Blue.
                            For This trip you need to buy a Z4 ticket.<br>
                            Other option it is to take an Uber or a Taxi. Please pay attention that the price should be below 20 euros.
                            If Uber is asking for a lot more due to the high demand, considert taking a taxi instead.

                    <p class="articletext insidecard">You can walk to the downtown. For walking we choose to start the city
                        walk heading to Bulhao or in the evening to have dinner to the Praca dos Poveiros. There are a lot of
                        good restaurants there.<br>
                        If you prefer go directly to Ribeira you should go to the Estação de Campanhã and to buy there a Z2 ticket.
                        You should there take the next train heading Porto Sao Bento. It is only one stop.
                        <br> Porto Sao Bento is a final station, all the trains driving from Porto Sao Bento stop in 
                        Estação de Campanhã, that means what when you are driving back home you can just take the first one 
                        departing.

                    When you buy a ticket, you always need to check the machine on the station where you are, for how
                    many zones you are crossing along your trip. <br>
                    On the ticket machine there is a list with all the names of the stations
                    and the respective number of zones you need to do the trip (Z2, Z3, etc.).
                    The ticket that you buy is rechargeable. <br> You can reload it and use it multiple times.
                    After you purchase your ticket on the machine, you need to validate it in the yellow machines that are on the platform.
                    The machines will beep and tell you how many trips you have left on the same card. <br>
                    A Z2 ticket is normally enough for any trip inside the downtonw of Porto. If you leave the downtown you will
                    probably need to change to a different Z number.
